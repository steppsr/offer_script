# offer_script

This is still a work in progress, but there is some basic functionality working.

You can generate a list of NFT IDs for a collection and save to a file.

Then use that file to create a script that will create the offer files for you.

Note(s):

* You must chose to "build" the script and not "execute".
* A sub-directory called "files" will be created.
* The end result is a bash script that can be run to create the offer files.
* This script does not create the actual offers.
* You should probably use at least 15 for the amount of seconds between offers.
